# Power Flow Analysis Refactoring

## Overview

The original `app.rb` file was refactored to follow Ruby and Sinatra best practices by separating concerns and applying the Single Responsibility Principle. The monolithic 663-line file has been broken down into smaller, focused classes.

## New Architecture

### Core Classes

1. **`PowerFlowAnalyzer`** (`lib/power_flow_analyzer.rb`)

   - Handles the core Newton-Raphson power flow analysis algorithm
   - Contains all mathematical calculations and iterations
   - Returns structured results data

2. **`CsvGenerator`** (`lib/csv_generator.rb`)

   - Responsible for generating CSV output files
   - Handles file creation and formatting
   - Separates file I/O from business logic

3. **`DataProcessor`** (`lib/data_processor.rb`)

   - Processes input data from CSV files and form parameters
   - Handles data parsing and validation
   - Counts entities (buses, lines) from parameters

4. **`PowerFlowService`** (`lib/power_flow_service.rb`)
   - Orchestrates the entire power flow analysis process
   - Acts as a facade for the other components
   - Coordinates data processing, analysis, and output generation

### Existing Classes (Unchanged)

- **`YBusCreator`** (`lib/y_bus_creator.rb`) - Creates Y-bus matrices
- **`CramersRule`** (`lib/cramers_rule.rb`) - Solves linear equations
- **`PolarToRect`** (`lib/polar_to_rect.rb`) - Coordinate transformations

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle**

- Each class has one clear purpose
- Easier to understand and maintain
- Reduced coupling between components

### 2. **Improved Testability**

- Individual components can be tested in isolation
- Mock objects can be easily substituted
- Unit tests are more focused and reliable

### 3. **Better Code Organization**

- Related functionality is grouped together
- Clear separation between web handling and business logic
- Easier to locate and modify specific features

### 4. **Enhanced Maintainability**

- Changes to one component don't affect others
- New features can be added without modifying existing code
- Bug fixes are isolated to specific classes

### 5. **Reusability**

- Components can be reused in different contexts
- Service classes can be called from other parts of the application
- Business logic is independent of the web framework

## File Structure

```

├── app.rb                          # Main Sinatra application (now ~80 lines)

└── ...
```

## Usage

The refactored application maintains the same external interface. Users interact with the same web forms and receive the same results. The internal architecture has been improved without changing the user experience.

### Example Usage in Code

```ruby
# Initialize the service
service = PowerFlowService.new

# Process CSV files
data = service.process_csv_files(bus_file, line_file)

# Perform power flow analysis
result = service.analyze_power_flow(params)
```

## Migration Notes

- All existing functionality is preserved
- No changes to views or routes
- Same CSV output format
- Compatible with existing test data

## Future Improvements

1. **Implement error handling** and validation
2. **Add logging** for debugging and monitoring
3. **Consider using dependency injection** for better testability
4. **Add configuration management** for constants and settings
